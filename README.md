# NEWYORK-TAXI-TRIP-DURATION--APACHE-SPARK
 Using Apache Spark, we have discovered insights that can help us understand the New York City taxi trip durations
# BIG DATA : Big data analytics helps us identify patterns, trends and relationships that may not be apparent at first glance.
#            By harnessing the power of Apache Spark and its scalable processing capabilities, we can extract valuable insights from large 
#            and complex data sets, making data driven decisions With the insights gained from big data analytics, organizations can make 
#            informed decisions based on data


# THE DISTRIBUTION OF TRIP DURATIONS: By visualizing the histogram, we gain an understanding of the spread and central tendency of trip durations.
# This is crucial for managing taxi operations and predicting customer wait times patterns based on pickup hours through the line graph.

# Patterns and Trends in 'average trip durations' based on the 'pickup hour'.
# This knowledge can HELP in optimizing 'taxi availability during peak hours 'and improving overall efficiency.
Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed processing system used for big data workloads. It utilizes in-memory caching, and optimized query execution for fast analytic queries against data of any size.
